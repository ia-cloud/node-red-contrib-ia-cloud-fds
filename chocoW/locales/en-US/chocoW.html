    <p>Choco-Tei Watcher is a video camera for the manufacturing line. It records the video of the timing 
       when there is an abnormality to check later. By inputting a signal called a trigger, the Choco-Tei watcher
       records video data before and after the trigger input timing and saves as a lock file. Also, by accessing Choco-Tei 
       Watcher Viewer (Choco-Tei Watcher's network address) from a browser on a PC connected to Cho-Stop Watcher, you can change 
       Choco-Tei Watcher settings and view recorded data.
       The Choco-Tei Watcher node is a node-RED node that reads recorded data and still image data from the Cho-Stop 
       Watcher using http communication and outputs it as an ia-cloud object. </p>
    <p>If msg.trigger is input other than NULL, 0, or false, the node sends the trigger command to the choc watcher to save a lock file.</p>

    <dt>checking Lock file</dt>
     <dd>Check the recorded video data (lock file) saved in the Choco-Tei Watcher every set cycle. 
        If lock files exist, all lock files are converted to ia-cloud file data object format and output, 
        and are deleted from the Choco-Tei watcher.
        Don't deploy the node-red flow while getting the video file, as it will cause malfunction.
        The lock file check interval can be selected from two types. </dd>        
     <dl class="message-properties">
         <dt>Each time check</dt>

     </dl>

    <dt>Still image acquisition function</dt>
    <dd>Get still image data from Choco-Tei Watcher. Still images can be acquired periodically or when a message is entered.
        Also, still image data can be output as an ia-cloud file data object, still image output for local monitor, or both. </dd>

        Configuration changes will be reflected when connected to Chocho-Tei Watcher by deploying the flow. </dd>
